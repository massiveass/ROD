  <h1>Rapid Ohia Death</h1> 
  <h3>What is happening to the native species?</h2> 
  <p>'Ohi'a, scientifically known as, Metrosideros polymorpha.</p>
  <p2>is the most abundant native tree in the state of Hawai'i, are currently dying from fungal diseases. Hundreds of thousands of 'Ohi'a have already died from this fungus, which is named Ceratocystis huli ‘Ohi’a. What appears to be healthy trees suddenly  die within a few days, which is why the disease is called, “Rapid 'Ohi'a Death” (ROD) The rapidly spreading fungus has killed trees in all regions of the Big Island and has the potential to kill all the 'Ohi'a trees statewide. Currently, the disease is found on the Islands of Hawai'i and Kauaʻi. Ceratocystis huli 'Ohi'a, the less devastating of the two fungal pathogens causing ROD, was detected on Kauaʻi in May 2018 (Nemo, 2018).</p2> 
  <h4>Disease spreads like wild fire but how?</4>
  <p> <bold>ROD spread via human activities and natural movements.</bold> The fungi enters through a wound, which can be caused in many ways and might not be visible. Humans can wound trees by running over roots with a lawnmower, cutting through bark with a weedwacker, cutting into trees to mark trails, etc. Strong winds, broken branches, included bark and roots growing over lava rock can also cause wounds large enough to allow the infection to seep in. Once the fungus enters the tree it grows into the vascular system (sapwood) and stops water from moving up to the head of the tree.</p>
  <h5>'Ohi'a; One of the pillars of Hawaii.</h5>
  <p>'Ohi'a is a Hawaiian name for several kinds of trees, but the one that stands out the most out of the rest is the 'Ohi'a lehua, scientifically know as Metrosideros polymorpha; Which is also considered as one of the most important native Hawaiian trees. 'Ohi'a lehua is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands -meaning that the 'Ohi'a tree cannot be found anywhere else on the Earth, it is a local species. 'Ohi'a trees covers roughly one million acres of land in the State of Hawai'i. The 'Ohi'a tree can be found at elevations from sea level to greater than 9000 ft.</p>
  <p2>They are often among the first plants to colonize fresh lava substrate and are therefore vital in the process of soil development and ecological progression. They provide shelter and food for numerous native birds, including endemic Hawaiian nectar-feeding honeycreepers such as the ʻapapane and ʻiʻiwi, as well as insects, snails, and other invertebrates. Their trunks supply nutrients, water and protection for local seedlings and epiphytes (a plant that grows on another plant, but not parasitic).</p2>
  <p3>Their canopies capture mists and rainwater that replenish the island aquifers, which provide drinking and irrigation water for Hawai'i’s communities and agricultural regions. 'Ohi'a trees are ingrained deeply into Hawaiian culture; Through symbolism, stories, songs, and chants. The trees also serve as physical manifestations of multiple Hawaiian deities (Sam ʻOhu Gon III, The Nature Conservancy 2016). 'Ohi'a are also highly valued economically. At present,  'Ohi'a wood is used for flooring, house posts, fencing posts, decoration, and firewood. The seedlings are also among the most wanted plants for native landscaping.</p3> 
  <p4>Overall, 'Ohi'a holds an ecologically and culturally importance. Thus, 'Ohi'a stands as one of the most vitally important trees of Hawaiian forests. Being such a vital natural resource for Hawai'i, the sudden rapid death of the 'Ohi'a trees creates many problems, putting researchers on edge to find a solution as soon as possible. The research process for the ROD contains enormous amounts of information, concluding that having an organized database, in which everything is located within a single software is the beneficial as the researchers and the community are able to learn from each other's findings. The researchers want the community to be involved as they are able to prevent the spreading of the disease, so giving the community a platform, such as an app, would also make the process of prevention easier and faster.</p4>
  <h6>Small act = Big difference</h6>
  <p><bold>HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD</bold></p>
  <p1>There is no effective treatment to protect ʻōhiʻa trees from becoming infected with Ceratocystis or cure for trees that exhibit symptoms of the disease. Therefore, each individual has an important role to help prevent the further spread of Rapid ʻŌhiʻa Death.</p1>
  <p2>1) Don’t move ʻōhiʻa wood or ʻōhiʻa parts. If the ʻōhiʻa material source is unknown, don’t move it.</p2>
  <p3>2) Don’t transport ʻōhiʻa inter-island. Follow the Hawaii State Department of Agriculture quarantine rule and don’t move ʻōhiʻa off of the Island of Hawaiʻi.</p3>
  <p4>3) Avoid injuring ʻōhiʻa. Wounds serve as entry points for the fungus and increase the odds that the tree will become infected and die from ROD. Avoid pruning and contact with heavy equipment wherever possible.</p4>
  <p5>4) Clean gear and tools, including shoes and clothes, before and after entering forests. Brush all soil off of tools and gear, then spray with 70% rubbing alcohol. Wash clothes with hot water and soap.</p5>
  <p6>5) Wash vehicle with a high pressure-hose or washer if you’ve been off-roading or have picked up mud from driving. Clean all soil off of tires and vehicle undercarriage.</p6>
